Run new_gui.py file
Then, follow below steps:

Step1> First user will enter the container ID in the top entry box. Then we will show all the contents present inside the container. Contents could be files like C files, python files, Docker file etc and folders, here ass1, ass2 etc.
Here, we will be mainly working with folders(like assignment1, assignment2 etc).
 
Step2> User will click on assignment folders or project and then on 'activate project and open with vs code'. Now we will ask the user where he/she wants to save/download the project in their local system. And after getting the directory, we will activate the selected project and  open the directory of the activated project in VS.
 
Step3> Now, user will do whatever changes/modifications he/she wants to do and then, the user will click on upload files, we will simply upload the updated folders (here, ass1, ass2 etc) from the local directory back to the container. 
 
 Step4> User will click on the activated project(the one on which user did modification) and then on the compile selected project. Here will compile the project using Makefile(this makefile will be present inside all the activated project and will be responsible for compiling the selected project) and show the compilation output or errors in bottom text box.
 
Step5> Now user will click on the run selected project and then we will show the output in the bottom text box.
